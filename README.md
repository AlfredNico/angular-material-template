# [Angular Material Template - Free Material Design Admin Application Template](https://onthecode.co.uk/product/angular-material-template/)

**[Material Application Template](https://onthecode.co.uk/product/angular-material-template/)** is a free Material Admin with a simple design inspired by Googleâ€™s Material Design. Material Application Template is scalable and has been built with the official style guide in mind. We have used various components from Angular Material library and other well-known open-source libraries such as momentjs, rxjs and ngx-logger.

Material Template is built with Angular and closely follows material design principles. The user flow is simple and effective: it starts with login, where user can log into the app or navigate to reset password page. Once logged in, the dashboard page welcomes the user. The navigation stays mainly on the left sidebar and the main content is on the right inside. User account is accessible from the top right-hand corner, where the user can change password.

This application template came as a result of several applications that we have developed over the past few years. We have always used Angular Material components and wanted to create a starter template to save time. We developed it based on user feedback and it is a powerful Angular admin dashboard, which allows you to build products like admin panels, content management systems (CMS) and customer relationship management (CRM) software.
